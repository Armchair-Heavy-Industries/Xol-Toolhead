# Xol, but simplified
An attempt to make Xol eaiser to build. No M2 hardware, no M2.5 heatsets.

Still has some M2.5 screws

## If you try this you agree to provide feedback
Please provide feedback into the Xol-Toolhead channel on the Armchair discord server.
Looking for build, printability and performance feedback.
Don't be shy.

## Printability testing
The HE mounts are completely re-worked and include the ducts (for 4010 blower versions). 
Because of this, there are some overhangs that I have printed successfully on a well tuned Voron 2.4 R2, and also on an old Ender 3 S1.

Filled filaments are probably a good cheat to help with this. 

## BOM Changes [Toolhead]
4010 blower versions use <br/>
4x M2.5 x 8mm SHCS to attach the blowers, and <br/>
4x M2.5 x 16mm SHCS to attach the 2510 HE fan.

The Extruder mount now uses 2x M3 x 16mm SHCS that go through from the front, instead of 20mm from previous versions.

### LEDs have changed
All of the HE mounts include a spot for sequin LEDs. I used the RGB type from Fysetc on Ali Express.
There are two of these sequins and a single Neopixel in the LED chain.
This is done so that the LED holders fit and there aren't separate parts for with/without LEDs. 
If you don't want LEDs, don't put them in. Print the diffuser in an accent colour and just sit it in place.

## BOM Changes [Carriage]
The Carriage is completely reworked into a single piece print (except probe modules). It has some extra M3 hex nuts and needs some bigger washers to clamp the carriage to the back of the MGN rail.

### Now using Archetype belt clips
You will need the M4 OD 0.45mm wall width tube just like for Archetype.

The M3 pin is 30mm now for all variations.

Supports: <br/>
MGN12h 6mm and 9mm belts<br/>
MGN9h 6mm and 9mm belts

####
Yes this is a rush job. It's pre-release and may never see a full release. I need your feedback to know if this is a good direcdtion for Xol-Toolhead.
