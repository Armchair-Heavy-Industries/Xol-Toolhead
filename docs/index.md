# Introduction

The Xol Toolhead is a soft reboot of the [Mantis Xol 2 toolhead](https://github.com/Armchair-Engineering/Mantis-Xol).

The Xol Toolhead was designed with modularity, low barrier of entry, ease of maintenance and quality of life in mind. Several quality-of-life improvements have been implemented over the original Mantis Xol 2 toolhead, making this toolhead truly a worthy successor to the original.

We have left the Mantis carriage behind, and thus are now just Xol-sans-Mantis.  
*Don't worry, it's still ugly, we couldn't fix that.*

## Atrocity

"Atrocity" is a local meme.
