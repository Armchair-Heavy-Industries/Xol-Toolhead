# Build instructions for Xol Toolhead LED harness
> [!WARNING]
> ## Sequin PCB thickness   
> The hotend mounts are only compatible with thin PCB board sequins.  
> Known compatible sources:<br/>
> RGBW: [LAB4450 (EU)](https://lab4450.com/product/rgbw-sequins/)<br/>
> RGBW: [Replimat[labs] (EU)](https://www.replimat.eu/4x-rgbw-sequins-for-xol-minisb/rt10179)<br/>
> RGB:  [FYSETC (Ali Express)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006023213341.html)


> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## LED Order
> Wiring as shown will result in the LED order being the same as for the popular StealthBurner LED harness.<br/>
> This should enable the use of popular LED control macros without complex modifications.
