| Get all the bits together (BoM) <br/><br/>(9x) Length of 26 or 28AWG electrical wire:<br/>- (3x) ~200mm with one end stripped and tinned<br/>- (6x) 70mm (sheath length) stripped and tinned at both ends<br/>(1x) Neopixel LED PCB<br/>(2x) Sequin LED PCB (0.8mm thick PCB board)<br/>JST XH (or similar) connector and pins to suit your printer | <img src='assets/images/led_harness/led_harness_parts.png' width=400 /> |
|	The first sequin LED in the chain is the most difficult as there are pairs of wires (5v+ and Gnd) that need to be connected to small solder pads.<br/><br/>- Solder 70mm and 200mm wires together to V+<br/>- Solder 70mm and 200mm wires together to Gnd<br/>- Solder a 200mm wire to DIN, and<br/>- Solder a 70mm wire to DOUT	|	<img src='assets/images/led_harness/led_back.png' width=200 /><br/><img src='assets/images/led_harness/leds_1st_sequin_alt.png' width=200 />|
| The three 70mm wires coming out of the 1st sequin are now soldered to the V+, DIN, and Gnd pads on one side of the neopixel PCB <br/>- All three wires should come into the PCB from the closest side to the pads, and in line with the pads.	|	<img src='assets/images/led_harness/neopixel_side1.png' width=200 />|
| Now solder the remaining three 70mm wires to the correct pads.<br/><br/>⚠️ **Ensure that these wires are positioned over the top of the other three and come over the PCB from the same side.**<br/>If they're not soldered like this, they won't go into the slot.	|	<img src='assets/images/led_harness/neopixel_side2.png' width=200 />|
| Last bit of soldering.<br/>Take the remaining end of the 2nd 70mm wires to the corresponding V+, DIN and GND on the last sequin LED PCB.<br/><br/><br/>It should now look something like this. Cut the excess of the 200mm wires to length and crimp on your connector.<br/><br/>Jobs done.	|	<img src='assets/images/led_harness/led_harness_assembled.png' width=200 />|
