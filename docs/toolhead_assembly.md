### These instructions are for off-printer assembly using Xol Carriage. If you use Voron TAP, scroll down, you have to do things differently.
The details below are for Rapido and Sherpa-Mini. We have faith that you can work it out from here if you're using a different combination of hotend and extruder. If you have trouble look for the #xol-toolhead channel on the Discord.

### Here lie the instructions for installing Xol Toolhead on Voron TAP. 
If you haven't noticed yet, it's easier on Xol Carriage, but we get it TAP is TAP.


|Notes | Image |
|---------|----------|
| `Install TAP into your printer as per Voron Design instructions` <br/> <br/> Once that's done, install the TAP adapter printed part for your extruder with <br/> * 2x M3 x 8 SHCS | <img src='assets/images/tap_toolhead/attach_tap_adapter.png' width=300 /> |
| Install heatsets as per instructions above <br/> `Make sure not to put any in the feet. You may need to run an M3 drill through the feet too.` | <img src='assets/images/tap_toolhead/lower_toolhead_no_heatsets.png' width=300 /> |
| Assemble the hotend mount with your hotend, 2510 HE cooling fan, faceplate parts and loosly attach the part cooling fans using the top screws only.  | <img src='assets/images/tap_toolhead/lower_toolhead_no_ducts.png' width=300 /> |
| Now you can slide the mostly assembled hotent mount parts up behind the extruder mount and onto TAP using <br/> * 2x M3 x 20 SHCS (top), <br/> * 1x M3 x8 BHCS (extruder mount to HE mount), and <br/> * 2x M3 x 12 SCHS (in the feet) <br/> <br/> <br/> `Make sure you have the PTFE tube that goes between the extruder and hotend installed before moving onto the next step. Failure to do so will end in tears` <br/> [PTFE Tube Lengths](PTFE_Length.md) | <img src='assets/images/tap_toolhead/hotend_mount_to_TAP.png' width=300 /> |
| Now you can attach the ducts and tighten all the M2 screws holding them, and the part cooling fans, on.  | <img src='assets/images/tap_toolhead/attach_ducts.png' width=300 /> |
| Put your extruder, stand offs, EBB board mount and EBB board together. | <img src='assets/images/tap_toolhead/extruder_and_board.png' width=300 /> |
| Attach your extruder/board etc. to the top of the TAP adapter plate. <br/> You're ready to finish wiring, software config and start printing. Sounds simples right? | <img src='assets/images/tap_toolhead/tap_dragonUHF_orbiter.png' width=300 /> |
