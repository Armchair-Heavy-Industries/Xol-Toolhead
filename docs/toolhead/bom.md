## Fans

| 1   | 2510 axial fan  | [Hot end](#hot-end)           | See below |
| 2   | 4010 radial fan | [Part cooling](#part-cooling) | See below |

> :information_source: **Understand your electronics and voltages**

> Do you have the correct voltage at your toolhead or will you need a converter?  
> If using the _recommended_ parts you need 5v, 12v and 24v at the toolhead.

### Hot end

Recommendations:

1. Delta Electronics ASB02505SHA-AY6B
    - 5V
    - This fan is highly recommended in heated chambers. No other 2510 fan comes close to the performance of this fan.
    - Available at [Digikey][ASB02505SHA-AY6B]

### Part cooling

Recommendations:

1. Delta Electronics BFB0412HHA-A
    - 12V
    - Available at [Digikey][BFB0412HHA-A]
2. Delta Electronics BFB0405HHA-A
    - 5V
    - Available at [Digikey][BFB0405HHA-A]

The Delta Electronics BFB0412HHA-A and BFB0405HHA-A provide the same airflow; pick whichever suits your setup better. Higher voltage (V) fans require less current (A) for the same power consumption (W).

Alternatively, 24V GDStime fans are fine and have been used with some success. Known negatives are the sometimes short or inconsistent lifetime, often overstated specifications, and overall worse durability.  
The Delta Electronics fans are our recommendation. They have better durability in heated chambers and always hit their performance claims.  
It's not uncommon for other fan manufacturers to overstate performance, GDStime included.

If you only have 24V available, you can use a step-down regulator like the [K78L12-500R3](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mornsun-america-llc/K78L12-500R3/16784476), or add an additional 12V power supply. If necessary, run an additional wire in your umbilical cord for this separate voltage rail.
