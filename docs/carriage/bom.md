## Probe Hardware

Follow probe instructions for required hardware. Where possible, self tapping screws have been replaced with heatset hardware, usually M2.

If using Voron Design TAP RC8+ it is recommended to replace the two M3 x 50 **SHCS** with M3 x 50 **BHCS** to improve build plate clearance.
