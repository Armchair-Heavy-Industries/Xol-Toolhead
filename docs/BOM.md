# Xol Toolhead Bill of Materials (BOM)
Read **ALL** of the sections below to understand your hardware requirements, there's some bits here that aren't on a standard Voron build BOM.
The chances are that something was missed, but if you have a good mix of M2, M2.5 and M3 hardware you'll probably still end up with a working printer.

## Carriage

#### Probe Hardware
Follow probe instructions for required hardware. Where possible, self tapping screws have been replaced with heatset hardware, usually M2.

`* If using Voron Design TAP RC8+ it is recommended to replace the two M3 x 50 SHCS with M3 x 50 BHCS to improve build plate clearance.`

#### Fans
> :information_source: **Understand your electronics and voltages** <br/>
> Do you have the correct voltage at your toolhead or will you need a converter?<br/>
> If using the _recommended_ parts you need 5v, 12v and 24v at the toolhead.

| Qty | Fan Type | Recommended Fan | Notes |
|-----|------|------|-----|
| 1 | 2510 Axial Fan <br/> Hotend Fan | Delta Electronics 5v <br/> ASB02505SHA-AY6B | <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/delta-electronics/ASB02505SHA-AY6B/7491489">Purchase Link</a> <br/> `This fan is highly recommended in heated chambers`<br/>`No other 2510 fan comes close to the performance`<br/>`of this fan.` | 
| 2 | 4010 Blower Fan <br/> Part Cooling Fans | Delta Electronics <br/> BFB0412HHA-A (12V) <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/delta-electronics/BFB0412HHA-A/2560487">Purchase Link</a> <br/> BFB0405HHA-A (5V)  <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/delta-electronics/BFB0405HHA-A/1014444">Purchase Link</a> <br/> |  `24v GDStime fans are fine and many have used them successfully.`<br/>`The Deltas, however, have better durability`<br/>`in heated chambers and always hit their performance claims.`<br/>`Its not uncommon for other fan manufacturers`<br/>`to overstate performance, GDStime included.`|

Additional notes: Delta's 5V and 12V variants provide the same airflow, pick whichever suits your setup better. If you only have 24V available, you can use a 24V-12V buck converter like [K78L12-500R3](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mornsun-america-llc/K78L12-500R3/16784476), or run an additional wire in your umbilical for 12v+.
