# Xol Toolhead
Xol Toolhead is the evolution of 'Mantis Xol 2' (<https://github.com/Armchair-Engineering/Mantis-Xol>).<br/>
Aimed at modularity and quality of life improvements for installation and serviceability.<br/>
We have left the mantis carriage behind, and thus are now just Xol sans Mantis. Don't worry, it's still ugly, we wouldn't fix that.
